# icecube_muon_simulator

The goal of this program is to simulate the trajectory of a muon that enters the earth from any direction, travels inside earth while getting deflected by earth magnetic field as well as losing energy inside the earth, and finally reaches the detector of Icecube located 2000 meters beneath the south pole.

The WMM.cof is the model used to simulate geomagnetic model

The result is a plot representing the expected cosmicray muon flux

The atmosphere neutrino has not been taken into account
